# Parking-algorithm
Algorithm for parking in short time and high accuracy

The parking experiment gives the coordinates of the five parking spaces, requiring the algorithm to be programmed so that the vehicle can park into the parking space in the form of a vehicle at the rear of the vehicle or at the front. The parking spaces are 5 known parking spaces and one unknown parking space. Accuracy (the four vertices of the vehicle from the standard position of the deviation) as a criterion, the faster, the higher the accuracy, the more perfect algorithm.
